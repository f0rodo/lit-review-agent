# Defined Lit Review Agent

## Win back your fridays! 

Like many other researchers and entrepenuers spend about 20% of our week on literature review. 
Can we automate our lit review approach?

## The Idea

* Researchers define a policy on their lit review
* They "teach" an LLM to make the review specific
* The agent searches and categories of paper based on the defined policy

## Next Up

* Hack up a simple version on pub med data
* Talk to a few researchers on defining policy
